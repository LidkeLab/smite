### Expected Results of [run_tests.m](../run_tests.m)

Note that some outputs have been removed due to size considerations as
noted in the following READMEs:
- [HMM](unitTest/HMM/README.md)
- [SMLM](unitTest/SMLM/README.md)

These tests were performed on a Linux system running Ubuntu 20.04 using
x86_64 processors running MATLAB R2021a.

The tests are frequently stochastic in nature, so outputs from run to
run will not necessarily be identical, even on the same system, but
the `ExpectedResults` will provide a flavor of what to expect.
