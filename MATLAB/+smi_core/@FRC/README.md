classdef FRC < handle

Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) class for computing average image resolution.
FRC is a measure of the average resolution over a super-resolution image.  It
works by dividing the set of single-emitter localizations in the
super-resolution image into two statistically independent subsets.  The
Fourier transforms of subimages generated from each of these subsets are then
statistically correlated over pixels on the perimeters of circles of constant
spatial frequency.  The image resolution is defined as the inverse of the
spatial frequency when the FRC curve drops below a threshold, taken to be
1/7 in the citation below.  Spurious correlations (for example, due to
repeated photoactivation of the same emitter) are removed by estimating the
number of times an emitter is localized on average (Q) assuming Poisson
statistics.

REQUIRES:
- DIPlib Image Resolution add-on
- Curve Fitting Toolbox (needed by qCorrectLocs)
- Parallel Processing Toolbox
- NVidia GPU

NOTE:
   Install the Image Resolution software at the same level as smite.
   This software is located at the URL above (see CITATION).  In startup.m,
   add a path to
```
      .../FRCresolution_software/matlabdistribution/FRCresolutionfunctions
```
   where often ... = /Documents/MATLAB.  In the FRCresolutionfunctions, copy
   smooth.m from the MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox into cfsmooth.m .  For
   example, look in
```
      MATLAB_DISTRIBUTION/toolbox/curvefit/curvefit/smooth.m
```
   This is needed because DIPimage also has a smooth function which will
   typically shadow MATLAB's smooth. 

properties:
```
   PixelSize   = 100;   % nm per pixel
   SRImageZoom = 10;    % image magnification factor
   Repeats     = 1;     % number of times FRC curve is computed for averaging
```

methods:
```
- **posToFRC**:
  calculates the Fourier Ring Correlation curve
- **posToResolution**:
  computes the image resolution from a list of localizations
- **qCorrectionLocs**:
  calculates Q-corrected FRC curves and resolutions
- **unitTest**:
  Test Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) interface functions and provide examples
  of usage
