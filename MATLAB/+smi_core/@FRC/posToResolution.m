function [resolution, frc_curve, resolution_hi, resolution_lo, ...
          resolution_t] = posToResolution(obj, SMR)
% posToResolution computes the image resolution from a list of localizations.
% The resolution is computed by taking blocks of localizations and assigning
% them randomly to half data sets.  The localizations in these sets are binned
% into 2 images from which the FRC curve and subsequently the resolution are
% computed.
%   
% INPUTS:
%    SMR             SMR structure with the following fields:
%       YSize        size (pixels) of the image
%       X,Y          (x, y) coordinates (pixels) of each localization [Nx1]
%       DatasetNum   dataset number of each localization              [Nx1]
%       FrameNum     frame number of each localization                [Nx1]
%       NFrames      number of frames in each dataset
%    obj:
%       SRImageZoom  image magnification factor
%       Repeats      number of times the FRC curve is computed for averaging
%
% OUTPUTS:
%    resolution      mean image resolution (pixels)
%    frc_curve       FRC curve vs. spatial frequency (1/nm)
%    resolution_hi   resolution + 1 standard deviation (pixels)
%    resolution_lo   resolution - 1 standard deviation (pixels)
%    resolution_t    mean of resolution over time
