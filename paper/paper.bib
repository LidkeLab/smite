   ABSTRACT = {We describe a robust, fiducial-free method of drift correction
               for use in single molecule localization-based super-resolution
               methods.  The method combines periodic 3D registration of the
               sample using brightfield images with a fast post-processing
               algorithm that corrects residual registration errors and drift
               between registration events. The method is robust to low numbers
               of collected localizations, requires no specialized hardware,
               and provides stability and drift correction for an indefinite
               time period.}

   ISSN = {2673-7647},
   ABSTRACT = {Many fluorescence super-resolution techniques, such as (d)STORM,
               PALM, and DNA-PAINT, generate datasets wherein multiple
               localizations across many camera frames may arise from a single
               blinking event of an emitter. These repeated localizations not
               only hinder interpretation and analysis of such datasets, but
               also represent an incomplete use of the fluorescence photons.
               Such localizations are typically combined into a single
               localization either by clustering with hard distance and time
               thresholds, or by classical hypothesis testing assuming Gaussian
               localization errors. In this work, we describe a method for
               clustering that accounts for localization precision, local
               emitter density estimates, and a kinetic model for blinking
               which is used to optimize connections within a group of
               spatiotemporally colocated localizations.}
